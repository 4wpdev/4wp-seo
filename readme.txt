Site-wide SEO inventory and Google Search Console in wp-admin—P1–P3 lanes, REST sync, URL inspection, indexing. Yoast & AIOSEO.

== Description ==

**4WP SEO Helper** gives you a **site-wide SEO Inventory** for WordPress: see missing titles and meta descriptions, score completeness, and mark business priority with drag-and-drop **P1 / P2 / P3** lanes.

Version **2.0** adds a full **Google Search Console** workspace inside wp-admin: connect your Google account, sync Search Analytics locally, inspect URLs, and see indexing status next to inventory rows.

Built for teams that use **Yoast SEO** or **All in One SEO** and need one place to audit SEO fields across posts, pages, and public custom post types.

A plugin by [4wp.dev](https://4wp.dev/). Overview and setup notes: [4WP SEO Helper on 4wp.dev](https://4wp.dev/plugin/4wp-seo-helper/).

= Perfect for =

* **SEO audits** — filter by missing title, meta description, or focus keyphrases
* **Content ops** — drag rows into P1–P3 lanes (business priority, not SEO score)
* **Bulk workflows** — quick edit SEO fields from the inventory table
* **Search Console ops** — overview, insights, performance breakdowns, URL inspection, and background data sync
* **Indexing workflows** — refresh index status and request indexing from the inventory table or admin bar
* **External sync** — REST API for Google Sheets or custom dashboards
* **Multilingual sites** — Polylang, WPML, or single-language

= How it works =

**SEO Inventory**

1. Activate the plugin (Yoast or All in One SEO recommended for read/write).
2. Open **4WP SEO → SEO Inventory**.
3. Review completeness scores and missing SEO fields site-wide.
4. Drag rows into **P1 / P2 / P3** to mark business priority.
5. Optional: enable the REST API under **Settings** and connect Sheets or your dashboard.

Priority reflects **business importance** (e.g. main service pages), not SEO score—a page can stay in P1 at 100% completeness.

**Google Search Console**

1. Enable **Google Search Console** under **4WP SEO → Settings**.
2. Open **Settings → Search Console** and add OAuth **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
3. Enable the **Google Search Console API** for the same Cloud project (OAuth alone is not enough).
4. Register the redirect URI shown on the settings screen in your OAuth client.
5. Click **Connect to Google** and sign in with an account that has access to this site in Search Console.
6. The plugin auto-matches the property for your WordPress site domain, or use **Local / staging mode** to pick a property manually.
7. Open **4WP SEO → GSC** for overview, insights, performance, URL inspection, and data sync.
8. Run **Sync now** to pull Search Analytics into WordPress (optional daily WP-Cron schedule).

If the connected Google account does **not** have access to this site's Search Console property, sync and GSC tools stay blocked until access is granted. The settings screen links to Search Console user management for the current site.

= Google Search Console features =

* **OAuth connection** — per-site Client ID/Secret, connect/disconnect Google account (tokens only; credentials stay saved)
* **Property picker** — auto-match by domain (`https://example.com/` or `sc-domain:example.com`) or manual selection for staging
* **Property access guard** — blocks sync and GSC menu until the connected account can access this site's property
* **Overview & insights** — clicks, impressions, CTR, position, branded vs non-branded query breakdown (configurable brand terms)
* **Performance** — Search Analytics by query, page, country, device, and search appearance with selectable date ranges
* **URL Inspection** — live index status for a single URL on the selected property
* **Data sync** — background manual sync and optional daily WP-Cron; stores metrics locally for inventory columns and reporting
* **SEO Inventory integration** — GSC clicks/impressions/top queries per row; index status, last crawl, refresh/request indexing actions
* **Admin bar** — quick Search Console inspect link on the front end when connected
* **Local development** — loopback OAuth redirect helper for `.local` / localhost sites

= Modules =

**Available in wp-admin:** SEO Inventory, Inventory REST API, Google Search Console.

**Coming soon:** TechArticle schema, LLMS.txt, and cross posting (visible as badges in Settings until a future release).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `wp-content/plugins/` or install through **Plugins → Add New**.
2. Activate **4WP SEO Helper** through the Plugins screen.
3. Install and activate **Yoast SEO** or **All in One SEO** for full inventory read/write.
4. Open **4WP SEO → SEO Inventory** to start auditing.

On activation, the inventory API token is created and the inventory module is enabled by default.

**Optional — Google Search Console**

1. Create a Google Cloud project and OAuth 2.0 **Web application** credentials.
2. Enable **Google Search Console API** in APIs & Services → Library.
3. Add the redirect URI from **4WP SEO → Settings → Search Console** to Authorized redirect URIs.
4. Complete OAuth consent / branding in Google Cloud (Testing mode is fine for private sites; add test users).
5. Verify the site exists in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) for the Google account you connect.
6. Connect in WordPress and run an initial sync under **GSC → Data sync**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Yoast SEO or All in One SEO? =

**Recommended.** The inventory reads and writes SEO meta through adapter plugins. Without Yoast or AIOSEO, the table still loads but bulk updates and meta writes are limited.

= What is P1 / P2 / P3 priority? =

Three configurable business tiers in the inventory table. **Priority is not SEO score**—you might keep a fully complete page in P1 because it is a key landing page.

= Can I export the inventory? =

Yes. Use **Export CSV** on the SEO Inventory screen to download titles, meta fields, completeness, priority, and missing-field flags.

= Is there a REST API? =

Yes. Base URL: `/wp-json/forwp-seo-helper/v1/seo-inventory`

Routes include `GET /meta`, `GET /items`, and `PUT /priority-queue`. Authenticate with a Bearer token from **4WP SEO → Inventory API** (Settings tab), or as a logged-in administrator with `manage_options`.

= Does it work with Polylang or WPML? =

Yes. Language filters and per-language rows are supported when a multilingual plugin is active.

= Which post types are included? =

Public post types with admin UI are discovered automatically. Core **post** and **page** are always included. Internal types without public front-end URLs (Elementor library, FSE templates, attachments, etc.) are excluded by default. Customize with the `forwp_seo_inventory_exclude_post_types` or `forwp_seo_inventory_post_type_is_viewable` filters.

= How do I connect Google Search Console? =

1. Enable the module under **4WP SEO → Settings**.
2. Open **Settings → Search Console**.
3. Paste OAuth Client ID and Secret from Google Cloud.
4. Enable **Google Search Console API** in the same Cloud project.
5. Copy the redirect URI into your OAuth client.
6. Click **Connect to Google**.

= Why does OAuth succeed but no property appears? =

Common causes:

* **Search Console API not enabled** in Google Cloud (OAuth and API are separate steps).
* The connected Google account has **no access** to this site in Search Console.
* The site is **not added or verified** in Search Console yet.

The settings screen shows the API error when Google returns one. Use **Disconnect**, fix Cloud Console / Search Console access, then connect again.

= Why are GSC tools or sync blocked? =

The plugin requires a matched Search Console property for **this WordPress site**. If your Google account cannot see that property, inventory GSC columns, the GSC menu, and sync stay disabled until access is granted. The settings screen provides a **Request access in Search Console** link for the current site (built from `home_url()`, not hardcoded).

= Can I disconnect Google without losing OAuth credentials? =

Yes. **Disconnect** removes tokens and the selected property only. Client ID and Secret remain saved so you can reconnect quickly.

= What does Local / staging mode do? =

Lets you pick any property from the connected Google account manually—useful when the WordPress site URL differs from the GSC property (local dev, staging, or multi-site workflows).

= Does sync run in the background? =

Yes. **Sync now** queues a WP-Cron job so you can leave the page. Optional **daily automatic sync** can be enabled under **GSC → Data sync**.

= What modules are coming soon? =

TechArticle schema and blocks, LLMS.txt, and cross posting are in the codebase but hidden behind **Coming soon** badges until a future release.

= Does it depend on other 4WP plugins? =

No. **4WP SEO Helper** runs on its own. The REST API can integrate with external tools such as Google Sheets or the 4WP Analytics Dashboard.

= Is this plugin affiliated with Yoast or WordPress? =

No. Yoast SEO and All in One SEO are separate products. **4WP** is our project brand name—**WP** appears only as part of that name and is not a reference to WordPress. This plugin is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by WordPress.

== External services ==

This plugin optionally connects to **Google APIs** when a site administrator enables **Google Search Console** integration under **4WP SEO → Settings**.

**Google OAuth 2.0** (`accounts.google.com`, `oauth2.googleapis.com`)

Used so an administrator can connect their Google account to WordPress. When the admin clicks **Connect Google**, the plugin redirects to Google sign-in and exchanges an authorization code for access and refresh tokens. Tokens are stored in the WordPress database and used only for Search Console features initiated in wp-admin.

**Google Search Console API** (`searchconsole.googleapis.com`)

Used to list verified properties, inspect URLs, and fetch Search Analytics for the connected property. The plugin sends the selected property URL, requested page URLs, and date ranges when an administrator runs sync, URL inspection, or live analytics tools in wp-admin. Synced metrics are stored locally in WordPress for reporting screens and inventory columns.

No Google API calls are made until an administrator configures OAuth credentials and connects an account. The plugin does not send site visitor or front-end user data to Google.
